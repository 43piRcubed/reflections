When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
     when sharing with people or even as a backup

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
     to have control over the local version.  It may notbe necessary to update local repository.  remote may not work properly and so forth.
